This repository contains the code of floreantpos hosted on Sourceforge: http://sourceforge.net/p/floreantpos/code/HEAD/tree/

Over the time I'm planning to extend the functionality of floreantPos by:

1) Different types of coupons e.g. gift cards as well as the possibility to buy a certain amount of dishes in advace. The second coupon is especially usefull for employeers wanting to buy meals for their employees, which then just have to know a certain secret code.

2) German Taxes: 
	19% on everything when dining in, but only 7% Taxes when taking out the meal.
	
	Already implemented: allow users to specify separate tax for takeout

3) Maybe some webservices allowing for the creation of a mobile app used by servers.
